# Hi, I'm Draylar!

I'm a student in my first year of a Computer Science program. I have a specific interest in software development and documentation, and love learning about new languages and programming concepts.

### Modding

For the past year, I have spent most of my time modding Minecraft using the [Fabric modding toolchain](http://github.com/FabricMC). 
A few of my biggest projects are:

 - [Vanilla Hammers](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/vanilla-hammers), a mod that adds simple 3x3-block-breaking tools to the game
 - [Draylar's Battle Towers](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/draylars-battle-towers), an adventure mod themed around large towers filled with treasure and monsters
 - [Identity](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/identity), a modern version of the popular [Morph](https://github.com/iChun/Morph)

Working with the Fabric toolchain has taught me a *ton* about the programming world. 
Since starting, I have drastically improved my documentation skills, API-design comprehension, writing prowess, Java knowledge, and my ability to interact with the users of my projects.
I have also had the opportunity to chat with people who are already heavily experienced in the programming/comp-sci field, which is a strongly valuable benefit to working in open-source projects. 

### General Development

I have also been working on improving my skills in languages outside Java. 
I recently wrote a project in NodeJS called [Minecraft Mapper](https://github.com/Draylar/minecraft-mapper) which takes a Minecraft game log and maps it using [Yarn](https://github.com/FabricMC/yarn). This project taught me about the full process involved in a website on both the client and server side, and was a good way to practice learning about JavaScript. Other languages I have experience with include Python and Kotlin.

Another fun project I made was [Invis URL](https://github.com/Draylar/invis-url), which converts URLs to invisible links using zero-width ASCII characters. This project was my first attempt at learning the basics of Rust.
